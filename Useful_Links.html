    </div>
        <h2>These links are to some websites I found useful when learning python</h2>
    <div class = "links">
        <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/python/"> <img class = "logo" src = "Images/W3Schools.png" alt = "W3Schools Logo"></img></a>
        <p>W3schools is a really useful website since it can allow you to search particular python functions and even gives snippets for you to try yourself.</p>

    <div class = "links">
        <a href= "https://stackoverflow.com/"><img class = "logo" src = "Images/stackoverflow.png" alt = "Stack Overflow Logo"></img></a>
        <p>Another website I use is called "Stack Overflow". This is where a lot of people post questions about code with others answering. It can be useful to use since you can find solutions to some problems you may have.</p>
        <a class = "nav-item" href = "https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a>

    <div class = "links">
        <a href= "https://trinket.io/"><img class = "logo" src = "Images/trinket.png" alt = "Trinket.io Logo"></img></a>
        <p>I used Trinket.io to embed my code into the examples page. It is a website that lets you code using python and run it in a seperate console. It comes with the ability to embed the code into another website.</p>

    <div class = "links">
        <a href= "https://www.python.org/"><img class = "logo" src = "Images/python.png" alt = "Python Logo"></img></a>
        <p>Python is the language used in the examples. You can download it here.</p>
        <a class = "nav-item" href = "https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>

    <div class = "links">
        <a href= "https://code.visualstudio.com/"><img class = "logo" src = "Images/visual studio.png" alt = "Visual Studio Logo"></img></a>
        <p>While you can use the IDLE python editor for coding I found that visual studio code was a lot more user friendly. It helps to identify errors in the code and allows for debugging easily.</p>
